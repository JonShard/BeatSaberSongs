### Why not upload to established song sharing platforms?
Beat Saber recently hopped out of Early Access, with the update came a native song loader.  
This means that the game can now load songs without the need for mods. This is great news.  
The issue is that **the native songs have a different format** for their ```Info``` files.
Existing song sharing platforms use the old format.  

So until BeatSaber adds a Steam Workshop, their own in-house sharing platform or the modding community adds support for native-songs, I will upload them here to avoid confusion.
