This repo is for the native versions of these songs. The normal moddable versions of the songs are on Beat Saver.

### Install Instructions:
**NO MODS REQURED**
1. Download the song's zip file. Located in the song's folder above this text.
1. Extract the zip in ```Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels```.

  If installed with Steam on C drive: ```C:\Program Files (x86)\Steam\steamapps\common\Beat Saber\Beat Saber_Data\CustomLevels```
1. Done, Beat Saber will now load the song.

### Why not **only** upload to established song sharing platforms?
Beat Saber has hopped out of Early Access, with that update came a native song loader.  
This means that the game can now load songs without the need for mods. This is great news.  
The issue is that **the native songs have a different format** for their ```Info``` files.
Existing song sharing platforms use the old format.  

So until Beat Saber adds a Steam Workshop, their own in-house sharing platform or the modding community adds support for native-songs, I will upload them here as well to avoid confusion.
